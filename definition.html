                    <b>ADB</b> - (Advance Debug Bridge) tool that comes in the Android SDK. ADB lets you modify your device via a PC command line.
	                ADB is mainly for developers to create and test their apps, but it can also be used to access your phone from your computer and run
	                some commands via your computer's command prompt. ADB is a client server program.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <br /><b>Android SDK</b> - (Software Development Kit) written by Google that enables developers to create applications for the Android
	                platform. The Android SDK includes sample projects with source code, development tools, an emulator, and required libraries to build Android
	                applications. In many cases, if you want to hack your phone, you will need to have the Android SDK installed on your computer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <br><b>APK</b> - Android application package file. Each Android application is compiled and packaged in a single file that includes all
                      of the application's code (.dex files), resources, assets, and manifest file. The application package file can have any name but must use the
	                  .apk extension. For example: myExampleAppname.apk. For convenience, an application package file is often referred to as an ".apk".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Backup / Nandroid</b> - Once your custom recovery is installed, you will want to make a backup (also known as a Nandroid). A Nandroid is simply a
	                complete and total backup of your phone. It will store all of your data, apps, settings, SMS messages, and more, basically allowing you to
	                restore your phone to the exact state that it was in when you made the backup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Boot Animation</b> - term for a graphical representation of the boot process of the operating system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Bootloader</b> - Before you can root your device, you must unlock your bootloader. The bootloader is a line of code that is executed even before
	                your Android operating system boots up. The bootloader's code is specific for each make and model of the many Android devices. Bootloaders
	                come locked because the device manufacturer doesn't want you tinkering with the software that they worked so hard to optimize for that
	                particular piece of hardware. Unlocking the bootloader allows you to tinker with the phone's firmware, or even replace it with a custom
	                firmware (aka: ROM). It is important to note that unlocking your bootloader will erase all data stored on your phone, essentially putting
	                it back to a factory reset state, so you'll want to save any pictures, music, or any other important files that are on your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Brick</b>  A brick is when your phone won't recover from a bad rooting/flashing process. Your device becomes unresponsive and unable to be
	                restored, essentially making it a brick or a very expensive paperweight. Bricking your phone usually happens when you do not follow
	                instructions carefully or if a device does not allow for root. Bricking your phone is a real possibility and risk in rooting and modding
	                your phone, but it is very rare to occur, and most unlikely to occur if you simply follow the instructions.
	                    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Hard Brick</b> - can't recover from anything short of a jtag rigging if that even works
		                <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Soft Brick</b> - bootlooping, recoverable without professional repair equipment               
                <li>
                    <br /><b>CPU</b> - (Central Processing Unit),  brains or the main memory of the phone and it is a place where most calculations such as addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication and division take place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Cache</b> - component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is
	                stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere. If requested
	                data is contained in the cache (cache hit), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise
	                (cache miss), the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the greater
	                the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the overall system performance becomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Dual Core</b> - central processing unit (CPU) that has two separate cores on the same die, each with its own cache. It essentially
	                is two microprocessors in one. This type of CPU is widely available from many manufacturers. Other types of multi-core processors also have
	                been developed, including quad-core processors with four cores each, hexa-core processors with six, octa-core processors with eight and
	                many-core processors with an even larger number of cores.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Fastboot</b> - diagnostic protocol used primarily to modify the flash file system in Android smartphones from another computer
	                over a USB connection. It is part of the Android Debug Bridge library. Utilizing the Fastboot protocol requires that the device be started in
	                a boot loader or Second Program Loader mode in which only the most basic hardware initialization is performed. After enabling the protocol
	                on the device itself it will accept any command sent to it over USB via a command line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Launcher</b> - part of the Android user interface on home screens that lets you launch apps, make phone calls, etc.
	                 Is built in to Android, or can be purchased in the Android Market in different forms. Common Launchers: TouchWiz, ADW, APEX, GO Launcher.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Mod</b> - modification made to the phone's software. This can include adding functionality or changing the visual layout of
	                your phone, like moving the location of the clock to the center of the notification bar, or inverting the colors in the SMS app. Mods are
	                usually Flashable Zip files that are flashed in the custom recovery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Nightly</b> - build that is performed at the end of each day of development. If you use a continuous integration server, it will generally be
	                configured to build the code and run the unit tests on every check in. At the end of each day you may want to run more extensive tests,
	                regression test and integration tests for example, which take too long to run on each check in and these would be triggered after the nightly
	                build. If you have a full continuously delivery pipeline the nightly build may also be used to deploy the built code to environments for user
	                testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Odex / DeOdex</b> - DeOdexing APKs is a way that developers optimize APKs (apps) to be compatible with different themes that
        	        themers have created. <a href="http://www.redmondpie.com/odexed-vs-deodexed-the-difference-between-the-two-android-roms-explained/" target="_blank">Explained in detail.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Overclock / Underclock</b> - This means that you have installed a custom Kernel that has allowed you to speed up or slow down your phone's
	                processor speed. Most phones are clocked at a certain processor speed (ie: 2.4 MHz), but if you overclock it, you are allowing your process
	                to push the limits by working at a higher speed. Overclocking will make your phone perform faster, but often comes at the expense of battery
	                life. Underclocking does the exact opposite of overclocking. It makes your processor perform at a lower speed, slowing down perceived
	                performance, but helps increase battery life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Partition</b> - phone's internal memory (not the SD card) is solid-state (flash) memory, AKA NAND. It can be partitioned much like
	                a normal hard drive can be partitioned. The bootloader exists in its own partition. Recovery is another partition; radio, system, cache, etc
	                are all partitions.
	                <br><br>Here are the standard partitions on an Android phone:

	                <br><br>/misc -  miscellaneous system settings in form of on/off switches.
	                <br>/boot - bootloader, kernel
	                <br>/recovery - holds the recovery program (ClockworkMod, TWRP, 4ext)
	                <br>/system - operating system goes here: Android, Sense, boot animation, firmware, busybox, etc
	                <br>/cache - cached data from OS usage
	                <br>/data - user applications, data, settings, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Recovery</b> - Once your bootloader is unlocked and you have rooted your device, you will need a custom recovery. A recovery is a piece of software
	                that is called up separate from the actual Android operating system. Its purpose is to make changes to the Android OS at a core level, such as
	                delete user data, apply updates and more. The stock recovery is limited in function, so if you are planning on modifying/hacking/rooting your
	                phone, you will need to install a Custom Recovery such as Clockwork Mod Recovery. A custom recovery will allow you to make backups, restore
	                them, wipe partitions, install custom software and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br /><b>Root</b> - Acquiring root is the process of gaining total control over your device. When you purchase your device, there are certain files
	                and systems that you cannot access because they are blocked by the manufacturer. By acquiring root you gain access to these files, allowing you
	                to modify, replace and even delete them. This allows you to take total control over how the software of your device looks and works.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Superuser (SU)</b>  If you follow the instructions and root correctly, you will become a Superuser (SU), which means you become a complete and
	                total admin of your device, allowing for most, if not all root permissions to be accessible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Updater Script</b> - When Android devices install updates via 'update.zip' files using recovery mode they have to perform a wide range of functions on
	                files and permissions. Instead of using a minimal shell such as {b,d,c}sh the Android designers decided to create a small functional language that can be extended
	                by device manufacturers if necessary. Since the Android "Donut" release (v1.6) the scripting language is called Edify and is defined primarily in the bootable/recovery/
	                {edify,edifyscripting,updater} directories of the Android source-code tree.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <br><b>Wipe</b> - Make sure you have a Nandroid backup first. Now you can wipe your phone without worry. Wiping is deleting all the user data from your
	                phone, essentially resetting it to its factory state. You can also wipe (ie: delete) other partitions of your phone like the cache partition.
	                It is always recommended to wipe your phone before installing a custom ROM. You can wipe your phone via the
	                custom recovery you installed.
