            <h3>What is the SuperUser App and what are some of the responsibilities within the phone?</h3>
            <p>Superuser is the app that manages what apps on your rooted device have access to su. Apps that are granted su have elevated permissions and can modify just about any part of the system. The app consists of two parts, Superuser.apk and the su binary. Superuser.apk runs as any other app and gives you, the user, a place to see what apps you have allowed or denied, as well as view a log of what apps have used su when. SU (short for Switch User) is a binary executable. It's used by Android and other *nix based systems to allow a process to change the user account it is associated with. </p>

        <article class="belowPicture">
            <p>Most times, when a phone is rooted, one of the apps listed (to the left) is already installed on the phone during the actual root method. However, if the rooting process fails to install a SuperUser app, then pick a Superuser App of your choice to be installed to the phone. </p>
            <img id="allowSU" src="NEW_IMG/allowSU.jpg" alt="su" height="500" width="300"/>
            <p>Once the SuperUser App is placed on the phone, you will be able to use certain apps that require special permissions. Only allow the apps that are trusted. Very bad news, if an untrusted app gains control of the phone system</p>

            <img id="bloatware" src="NEW_IMG/bloatware.png" alt="bloatware" width="98" height="98" /> 
            <p>Most people root their phones to remove bloatware. Bloatware is a software whose usefulness is reduced because of the excessive disk space and memory it requires. Phone manufacturers tend put these apps on the phone with system user rights, so that they can't be removed without root permissions. Bloatware apps take up space on a phones internal memory, as well as run down the battery from starting up as background processes. Now that the phone is rooted with the SuperUser app, and can give permission to a bloatware removing app, you can remove the bloatware applications off the phone.</p> 
            <hr />
            <p>The phone can also now be <b>overclocked</b> which is pushing the clock to tick faster. Processor and memory can be overclocked. Pushing it to work faster produces more heat, and	some other effects may become visible too. Or the phone can be <b>underclocked</b>, which is lowering the speed, slowing down the clock. Every component has factory setting for default frequency. This is going slower than that. Underclocking is important on phones. If you slow things down a bit - it uses less power per second and it produces less heat (cooler easily cools it).</p>
